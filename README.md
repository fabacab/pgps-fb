= Facebook Preferred Gender Pronouns =

This tool is a simple implementation of "[gender as a text field](http://maybemaimed.com/2011/06/30/ssexbbox-gender-is-a-text-field/)" rather than a binary drop-down, intended to replace the default Facebook profile field called "sex." (Because, for fuck's sake, Facebook, gender is not the same as sex and you should know better.) This mimics the way [Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/) handles gender, which is far more respectful.

This app allows you to self-identify your gender to your friends however you like. When you change your preferred gender pronouns, it also sends a Facebook notification to your friends who have installed this app to let them know of your new pronoun preference. This helps avoid that awkward moment when references to a person are confusing due to a gender change.
